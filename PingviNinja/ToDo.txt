If you're looking to improve this project some more, and you're able to steer yourself away from the particle editor for a few minutes, why not have a go at removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names. You could also try adding a new and fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
